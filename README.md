### PLACE HOLDER

Hello there, my name is JesÃºs LeÃ³n. I am an accountant specialized in tax, as well as a full stack developer.

Through my day job as an accountant, the concept of automizing the extraction, aggregation and presentation of data has triggered a passion for programming. 

I aim to develop solutions which optimize our time in the workplace, reducing the need for overtime dedicated to repetitive tasks.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app which automatically extracts and organizes the information in electronic invoices.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Python, Javascript, React, Flux and SQL.
